[`Tallaght Rehabilitation Project is a Community based
rehabilitation day-programme for people in recovery from drug and
alcohol addiction and who reside in the Tallaght Wide area. The
programme was developed as a ‘continuum of care’ to assist those
who have become drug or alcohol free or who are stable in
treatment on prescribed methadone.`, <br />, <br />, ` Working from a therapeutic and
holistic ethos the programme aims to provide opportunities to
enable participants to actively address behavioural issues which
may underpin addiction problems and to develop and enhance life
skills and facilitate personal growth and recovery.`, <br />,
