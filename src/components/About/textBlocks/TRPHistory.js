  `Kiltalown House means ”Church of the Elms” and it is a suitable name for this ancient townland. The old church existed until the 17th Century. In 1800 John Carpenter, the then owner of the land, demolished it completely and on the old foundations built a house in.`,

  `In the past Kiltalown House has had many tenants. The house and lands were only owned by four people over the years, James Robinson, Joseph T.Pratt, John Robinson and W. Jolley.`,

  `The Jolley family was the last dynasty to inhabit the house. Mr. W. Jolley bought the land and house from the Robinson’s and lived there until 1987.`,

  `In 1987 the Jolley family gave the house and the remaining land to Dublin County Council. The house was badly damaged in a fire in 1988, the house was repaired and has been a great asset to the whole community as it was used for community work and also as a creativity centre. Its coming of birth was due to a small number of dedicated local women, under the inspiration and vision of Sister Imelda Smith, who had just returned from California with a master’s degree in spirituality.`,
