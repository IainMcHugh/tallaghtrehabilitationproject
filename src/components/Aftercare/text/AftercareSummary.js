  `The Aftercare is a relaxed person centred service that seeks to support and consolidates individuals post rehabilitation.
    The service maintains a continuum of care and is designed to meet the needs of those who access it to enable them to reintegrate back into the community in a way that maximizes individual supports and resources. We believe as a team that this is a supportive and nurturing setting for people who have engaged in rehab. Tallaght-wide aftercare service provides a friendly social setting for the participants where they can relax, and talk amongst their peers in a safe and positive environment. The aftercare holds various educational and informative workshops, which are important for maintaining an individualâ€™s recovery. On top of this, the aftercare hosts organised events throughout the year, these social events are enjoyed by all in a safe and supportive environment. "TO ENTER 2019 EXAMPLE HERE"`,
