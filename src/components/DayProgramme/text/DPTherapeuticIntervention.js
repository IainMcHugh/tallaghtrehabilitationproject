    `The Therapeutic component of the programme, forms the core around which all
    other sessions are interwoven. All the work in TRP is carried out in a safe,
    healthy, confidential, caring and nurturing environment. The programme aims
    to provide a broad based humanistic approach to the issue of drug and
    alcohol use, in a therapeutic/psycho social model which has a non-medical
    approach.`,

    `By ‘therapeutic’ we mean to heal, to assist and to help restore a person’s
    well being. There is a vast and varied approach to the programme at TRP and
    in fact all sessions have a development and therapeutic aspect to them. We
    endeavour to support participants to evaluate and become aware of
    self-destructive thinking and behaviours which may underpin serious
    addiction problems.`,

    `Participants are also asked to commit to a residential weekend within the
    duration of their programme. The residential setting is used to explore
    issues of loss and bereavement, relationships, life stories, etc..`
