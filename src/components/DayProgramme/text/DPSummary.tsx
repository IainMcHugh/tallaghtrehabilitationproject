  `TRP is a dedicated specialist rehabilitation project in the Tallaght area providing a community based day-programme for people in recovery with addiction problems. The programme is specifically designed to provide a safe and confidential environment where participants can actively engage in a therapeutic process of recovery. The overall objective of the programme is to assist and support the rehabilitation and recovery process and realistic progression of people who have become stable in treatment on prescribed methadone or who have achieved drug free status. Our mission statement comes from a community development ethos, which believes in the benefits of rehabilitation within a community setting and where participants can be supported in their recovery, by their own community. TRP contributes to local development through providing this necessary service for people with addiction problems.`,
