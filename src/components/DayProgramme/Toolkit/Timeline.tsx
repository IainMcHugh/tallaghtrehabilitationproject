      <h2>Introduction to Day Program</h2>
      <h3>0-3 months</h3>
      <h4>
        The Introduction programme allows applicants become acclimatised to the
        nature and structure of the programme and allows the staff team to
        further assess the applicant’s suitability and readiness to engage in
        the rehabilitation process.

      <h2>Phase 1</h2>
      <h3>3-6 months</h3>
      <h4>
        Phase 1 is designed to facilitate participants in gaining an
        understanding of and confidence in group work and become familiar with a
        therapeutic / educational environment. It is an opportunity to establish
        a routine, to stabilise practical aspects of participants’ lifestyle and
        set realistic goals. The emphasis is on addiction awareness, looking at
        attitudes to recovery, learning strategies to prevent relapse and
        becoming aware of the pitfalls in early recovery.

      <h2>Phase 2</h2>
      <h3>6-9 months</h3>
      <h4>
        Phase 2 is designed for people with a level of awareness suited to
        actively and realistically work toward change. Here there is a greater
        emphasis on therapeutic group work, which is more challenging for
        participants. Through particular interventions participants are
        encouraged to gain a better understanding of their addiction and address
        any underlying issues. This phase is marked by lifestyle stability and
        also a deeper level of awareness and a willingness to explore and
        process the issues, behaviours and attitudes related to addiction. Some
        family involvement would be encouraged at this stage.
